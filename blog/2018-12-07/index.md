# Part 1 - Individual Accomplishments this Week
* Paste a link to your whiteboard interview. You may keep this set to private and add your PM, but you are encouraged to set it to unlisted. (Weeks 2-4)

* Paste your team’s github contribution graph here and indicate your Github Handle:

* Provide a paragraph (5-8 sentences) summarizing the work you did this week, the challenges you faced, the tools you used, and your accomplishments.

I was unfortunately unwell this week and therefore unable to put in as much work as I would have liked. I actually still feel horribly unwell even now and I hate that I have to rush through this dev journal but oh well, I guess it's good practice for the future. Anyway, I think I'm one of the few people who actually likes working with CSS, so I'd been looking forward to spending all week on it. Unfortunately (there always seems to be an unfortunately, and this is the second one in four sentences, yikes), we all realized/discovered that much of our code is/was such a hot mess that we needed to make adjustments to it before working on the CSS. We rediscovered that this problem was even more of a tangle than we thought half-way through the week. I suppose we learned a lot from it, but I'm hoping I get to spend much more time making things pretty next week.

## Tasks Pulled
List the tasks you pulled this week, and provide a link to the successfully merged PR completing that task and the trello card for that task.  You must have at least one front end and one back end. The expected total is 6 with a minimum of 4.

* Front End
https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/Labs8-MealHelper/pull/115
https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/Labs8-MealHelper/pull/130
https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/Labs8-MealHelper/pull/137
https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/Labs8-MealHelper/pull/151

* Back End
The back end is pretty much done. I think the only work done on it this week was putting routes back in that were accidentally deleted in merges, but we're not deploying the master branch on heroku so PRs aren't required for those little fixes.

## Detailed Analysis
Pick one of your tickets and provide a detailed analysis of the work you did.  This should be approximately ¼ page of text, and at least three screenshots.

I spent most of my time in alarms again this week, but I had a lot of fun! I had originally used `react-select` for my drop-down menus on the alarm adds, but since I was having so much trouble styling them and the boys had used `reactstrap` on the other pages, it seemed better to change over to that, so I did! 



And this meant refactoring the way I was grabbing values and sending them to state.

# Part 2 - Milestone Reflections
