* Provide a paragraph (5-8 sentences) summarizing the work you did this week, the challenges you faced, the tools you used, and your accomplishments

I worked almost entirely on the Alarms page this week and learned just how rusty I was on React and Redux. I'm definitely seeing the value of doing Labs before CS! The biggest challenge was mainly remembering how to interact with Redux state and when to use component state vs reducer/global state. I also found myself leaning a little too hard on a previous assignment at one point and found that I was creating a component we didn't need, so I was able to switch my thinking and come up with a better solution for the current project. A fear I had while working through the first three months of Lambda was that I would struggle too much to build something new. This helped encourage me and reminded me that problem-solving is part of the fun of developing. I think it helped mediate some of my impostor syndrome and anxiety as well.
